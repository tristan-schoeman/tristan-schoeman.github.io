# Hi, I'm Tristan 👋

Mechanical engineer with a focus on **controls, structural dynamics, and prototyping**.  
I love building at the intersection of **mechanics and intelligence** — from MATLAB simulations and control algorithms to hands-on projects with computer vision and audio ML.

- 🎯 Current focus: Robotics, mechatronics, and applied AI for physical systems  
- 🛠️ Side projects:  
  - [CatGuard](https://github.com/tristan-schoeman/catguard) — Humane cat-scratch deterrent using vision + audio  
- 🚴 Outside work: Gravel cycling, triathlon training, and tinkering with endurance tech

---

## 🔧 Tech & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, MATLAB, some C++  
- **Domains**: Controls & system identification, structural/FEA awareness, prototyping  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, PyTorch (learning), audio DSP basics  
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors, mechatronics integration
