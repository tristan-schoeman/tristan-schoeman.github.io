# Hi, I'm Tristan ðŸ‘‹

Mechanical engineer with a focus on **controls**, **structural dynamics**, and hands-on prototyping. Iâ€™m building projects that blend **computer vision**, **audio ML**, and **robotic control**.

- MS focus: controls & system identification
- Recent: gravel bike projects, Salida 76 prep, and a humane cat deterrent system
- Seeking roles across **robotics**, **mechatronics**, **perception**, and **controls**
